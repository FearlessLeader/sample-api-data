These are sound files for the freeCodeCamp Drum Machine project. The drum machine is configured to play different types of instruments based on the files imported into the app.

Currently there are three types of instruments configured for the drum machine, drums, piano and guitar. Instruments can be changed or switched by adding a new instrument file. Simply follow the format of the json file in the drums, piano or guitar directories.

The app currently supports up to three (3) instruments and will display the first instrument in the list.
