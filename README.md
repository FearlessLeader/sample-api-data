# sample-api-data

Setting up this repository to learn more about github-pages and also to learn about serving static data files from github-pages.

Will be using sample api data for some of the `freeCodeCamp` **Front-End Certification** and **API Data Certification** projects.

Feel free to copy any of these data files and use them in your projects as sample data.
